Encapsulation is a principle in object-oriented programming that bundles data (properties) and methods (functions) together within a class, hiding internal implementation details from the outside world. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, providing a level of data protection and preventing direct manipulation of the object's properties. The purpose of encapsulation is to ensure data integrity, promote code modularity, and provide a clear interface for interacting with objects while maintaining their internal workings hidden.
