OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable objects. It revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It allows you to model real-world entities and relationships between them, providing a modular and structured approach to writing code.
