Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types, providing flexibility and reusability. The purpose of polymorphism is to simplify code by allowing the same interface to be used for objects with different underlying implementations, promoting code extensibility and flexibility.
