Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, known as the superclass or base class. The class that inherits from the superclass is called the subclass or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its characteristics while adding or modifying functionality. It enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes and is a key feature for achieving code organization and extensibility.
