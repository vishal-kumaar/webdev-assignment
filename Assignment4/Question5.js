// The difference between let and const are:-

// Variable Assignment:

// Variables declared with let can be reassigned to a new value.
// Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned once they are assigned a value. They are considered constants.

let x = 10;
x = 20; // Valid reassignment with let

const y = 10;
y = 20; // Error: Cannot reassign a const variable
