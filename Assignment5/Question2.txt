Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of the web, Web APIs provide functionality and access to resources of web servers, enabling developers to interact with web services, retrieve data, and perform various operations such as sending HTTP requests, manipulating documents, or accessing device features.
