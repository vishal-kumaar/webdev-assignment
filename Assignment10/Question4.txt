MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB adopts a document-oriented approach, storing data in flexible and schema-less JSON-like documents, known as BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for easy and dynamic data modeling, making it well-suited for applications with evolving data requirements.

MongoDB's key features include horizontal scalability through sharding, which enables it to distribute data across multiple servers for high-performance and availability. It also provides powerful querying capabilities, indexing, and aggregation pipelines for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. MongoDB is commonly used in modern web development, analytics, and real-time applications, where it can handle diverse data types and massive datasets with speed and ease.
