A RESTAPI (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and principles for building web services that allow different systems to communicate over the internet. It follows a stateless client-server architecture, where each request from a client contains all necessary information. Resources are identified by unique URLs, and standard HTTP methods are used to interact with these resources.
RESTful APIs are resource-based and provide multiple representations of data, such as JSON or XML. They are widely used due to their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with HTTP, making them the standard for developing web services in various applications, including mobile app backends, cloud services, and system integrations.
