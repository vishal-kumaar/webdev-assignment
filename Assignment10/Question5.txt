Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB in Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction over MongoDB, making it easier for developers to interact with the database by defining schemas and models for their data.

In the context of MongoDB, a schema is a blueprint that defines the structure of the documents (data) that will be stored in the database collection. It specifies the fields, data types, default values, and other constraints for the documents. Mongoose allows developers to create and manage schemas, providing validation and data consistency while interacting with MongoDB.

Furthermore, Mongoose introduces the concept of models, which are constructors compiled from the defined schemas. Models represent collections in the MongoDB database and provide an interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.
