The orientation media feature in CSS is used to target and apply specific styles based on the orientation (portrait or landscape) of a device's viewport. By using this feature within media queries, developers can customize the layout, positioning, and typography to ensure optimal usability and visual experience.
For example, they can adjust the width and height of elements, reposition content, or change font sizes to better accommodate different orientations. The orientation media feature enables responsive design that adapts to the device's orientation, enhancing the user experience across various devices and screen orientations.
