A media query in CSS is a feature that allows web developers to apply specific styles to a webpage based on certain device characteristics, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation. It enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt to different devices and optimize the user experience. By using media queries, developers can customize the layout, typography, and other visual aspects of a website, ensuring it looks and functions well across various screen sizes and devices. Media queries are instrumental in implementing mobile-friendly and flexible designs in modern web development.
