VW (Viewport Width) refers to a percentage of the total width of the viewport. For example, 1vw represents 1% of the viewport width. This unit is useful for creating responsive designs that scale proportionally based on the width of the viewport.

VH (Viewport Height) is similar to VW but represents a percentage of the total height of the viewport. For instance, 1vh corresponds to 1% of the viewport height. VH is commonly used to create elements that adapt to the height of the viewport, ensuring proper layout on various devices.
