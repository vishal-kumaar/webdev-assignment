The Box Model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin. The content layer holds the actual content, such as text or images. The padding layer creates space around the content, while the border layer defines a border around the padding. The margin layer sets space outside the border, creating a gap between elements. Each layer can be customized using CSS properties like width, height, padding, border-width, and margin. Understanding the Box Model is crucial for accurately positioning and styling elements on a webpage.
