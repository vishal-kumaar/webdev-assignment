z-index is a CSS property that controls the stacking order of positioned elements on a webpage. It determines which elements appear in front or behind others in the z-axis. The higher the z-index value, the closer an element is to the viewer, and the more it overlaps other elements.Elements with a higher z-index will be positioned in front of elements with a lower value.
By default, elements have a z-index of auto and are stacked in the order they appear in the HTML. The z-index property only works on elements with a specified position value (e.g., relative, absolute, fixed).
