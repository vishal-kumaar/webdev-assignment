Different types of selectors in CSS include type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, descendant selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. Type selectors target elements based on their HTML tag name, class selectors select elements based on their class attribute, and ID selectors target unique elements based on their ID attribute. Attribute selectors match elements based on specific attribute values. Descendant selectors select elements that are descendants of other elements. Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow for targeting elements based on states or specific parts of an element. These selectors provide flexibility, reusability, specificity, interactivity, and modularization, enabling precise styling and layout control.
