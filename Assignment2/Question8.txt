1. Absolute vs. Relative Positioning:-

a. Absolute positioning: An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the containing block. It is taken out of the normal flow of the document.

b. Relative positioning: A relatively positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. It retains its position within the flow, and other elements are not affected.

2. Sticky vs. Fixed Positioning:-

a. Sticky positioning: A sticky positioned element is initially in the normal flow, but it becomes fixed (stays in place) when the user scrolls to a certain threshold. It toggles between relative and fixed positioning based on the scroll position.
b. Fixed positioning: A fixed positioned element is positioned relative to the viewport and remains fixed even when the page is scrolled. It does not move with scrolling.
