The difference between class-based and function-based components lies in the way they are defined and their capabilities. Class components are defined as ES6 classes and extend the React.Component class. They can have their own state, lifecycle methods, and use this to access their instance. Function components, on the other hand, are defined as JavaScript functions and accept props as input. They are stateless by default, but with the introduction of React Hooks, function components can also handle state and lifecycle management using useState, useEffect, and other hooks. Function components are simpler, easier to read, and promote a functional programming approach, while class components offer more advanced features and are useful for complex state management or integrating with older codebases.
