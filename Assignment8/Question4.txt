In React, a component is a reusable and self-contained unit that encapsulates the UI logic and presentation. Components can be considered as building blocks of a React application. There are two main types of components: function components and class components. Function components, also known as stateless or presentational components, are defined as JavaScript functions that accept props as input and return JSX elements to describe the component's UI. Class components, on the other hand, are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have additional features such as state management and lifecycle methods. Both types of components offer different approaches to building UI in React, catering to different requirements and preferences.
