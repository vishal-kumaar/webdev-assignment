The Virtual DOM is a concept in React where a lightweight representation of the actual browser DOM is maintained in memory. It serves as an intermediary layer between the React components and the browser's rendering engine. When changes occur in the state or props of a component, React updates the Virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the real DOM. By doing so, React can perform a diffing algorithm to identify the specific changes needed to update the real DOM efficiently. This approach minimizes the number of actual DOM manipulations and improves performance. Once the changes are identified, React applies them to the real DOM in a batched manner, reducing the overhead of individual DOM updates.
