 The Virtual DOM and the Real DOM are two representations of the UI in React. The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual browser DOM that React maintains in memory. It allows React to perform efficient updates by comparing the previous and new versions of the Virtual DOM and determining the minimal set of changes needed to update the Real DOM. This process, called reconciliation, reduces the number of direct manipulations of the Real DOM and improves performance. In contrast, the Real DOM is the actual browser's representation of the HTML structure. Manipulating the Real DOM can be computationally expensive due to the required reflow and repaint operations. The Virtual DOM acts as a layer of abstraction, allowing React to optimize rendering and efficiently update the Real DOM.
