Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing props through multiple layers of components that do not need the props themselves. It can occur when a parent component passes props to a child component, which then passes them to its child component, and so on. This can lead to unnecessary prop passing through intermediate components that do not use the props directly. Prop drilling can make the codebase harder to maintain and understand.

To avoid prop drilling, you can use other techniques such as context API, Redux, or React's useReducer hook. Context API allows you to create a shared state that can be accessed by nested components without the need for prop passing. Redux is a popular state management library that centralizes the application state and provides access to it from any component. The useReducer hook, along with React's Context API, can be used to manage state locally within a component or a specific subtree. These techniques help in avoiding excessive prop passing and keep the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
