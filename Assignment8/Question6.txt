React component lifecycle refers to the sequence of phases a component goes through from initialization to unmounting. Class components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into these phases and perform certain actions. The lifecycle can be divided into three main phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. During the mounting phase, the component is created and inserted into the DOM. In the updating phase, the component re-renders when there are changes in its state or props. Finally, in the unmounting phase, the component is removed from the DOM. Lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount provide hooks to perform actions at specific points in the component's lifecycle. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also achieve similar functionality using the useEffect hook.
